# Hint 1:
# The public functions/attributes of `RasterGrid` do not have meaningful names.
# For instance, what does `c` do? There must be a better name.
# Also, `nc` is a public attribute whose name doesn't really express what it means.


# Hint 2:
# `RasterGrid` receives a whole bunch of arguments. The number can be reduced
# significantly by collecting some of them into appropriate data structures.
